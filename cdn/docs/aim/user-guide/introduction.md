# What is AIM?

FWS Access and Identity Management (AIM) is a service that provides a secure and efficient way to manage access to FWS resources. AIM is a centralized service that provides a single point of access to all FWS resources. AIM is designed to be easy to use and to provide a consistent user experience across all FWS resources.

## Root user

When you sign up for Festify Web Services, you are given a root account. This account is the highest level of access to FWS resources. The root account is used to create and manage other accounts, as well as to manage access to FWS resources. We strongly recommend that you don't use the root user for your everyday tasks. Safeguard your root user credentials and use them to perform the tasks that only the root user can perform.

## AIM user

An AIM user is an account that is created by the root user. An AIM user is used to access FWS resources. An AIM user can be assigned permissions to access specific resources. Set up AIM users for your team members so that they can access the resources they need to do their jobs without having to use the root user account.

### Access key

An access key is a pair of security credentials that are used to access FWS resources programmatically. An access key consists of an access key ID and an access key secret. You can create access keys for an AIM user and use them to access FWS resources programmatically using the APIs and SDKs provided by FWS.

## Permission policy

A permission policy is a document that defines the permissions that an AIM user has to access FWS resources. A permission policy is a JSON document that specifies the permissions that an AIM user has to access specific resources. You can create permission policies for AIM users and attach them to the AIM users to grant them the permissions they need to access the resources they need from the FWS AIM console.

## Access Management

After you have created an AIM user and assigned permissions to the AIM user, you can manage access to FWS resources using the AIM console. The AIM console provides a graphical user interface that you can use to manage access to FWS resources. You can use the AIM console to create and manage AIM users, create and manage permission policies, and assign permissions to AIM users.
