# Setting up Festify Basic Email Service

Before you start using Festify BES, you must complete the following tasks.

## Sign up for Festify Web Services

If you do not have an AWS account, complete the following steps to create one.

To sign up for an FWS account

1. Open the [FWS Sign-up page](/a/register).

2. Follow the online instructions.

   Part of the sign-up procedure involves receiving an email with the verification code. You must enter the verification code to complete the sign-up process.

   When you sign up for an FWS account, an FWS account root user is created. The root user has access to all FWS services and resources in the account. As a security best practice, assign administrative access to a user, and use only the root user to perform tasks that require root user access.

## Set up your BES account

After you sign up for Festify Web Services, you can set up your BES account.

To start sending emails

1. Log in to the [FWS Management Console](/home).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Festify BES**.

3. Create an instance of Festify BES by entering your email address and password.

   After you create an instance, you must verify your email address by clicking the link in the email that you receive.

4. After you verify your email address, you can start sending emails using Festify BES.

## Grant programmatic access to your BES account

To grant programmatic access to your BES account, you must create an access key.

To create an access key

1. Log in to the [FWS Management Console](/home) and navigate to the [Festify AIM console](/aim).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Users**.

3. Choose the user for which you want to create an access key. Click on generate access key to generate an access key for the user.

   Make sure to save the access key ID and secret key in a secure location. You will not be able to retrieve the secret key again.

4. Use the access key ID and secret key to access Festify BES programmatically.

## Download the Festify BES SDK

To access Festify BES programmatically, you can use the Festify BES SDK.

To download the Festify BES SDK, navigate to the [Festify BES SDK page](/docs/sdk).
